By the end of this lab, you should be able to: Read-in and summarise table/spreadsheet data (data.frames) Select subsets of a data.frame using square brackets and the $ sign Plot specific columns of a data.frame against each other (E.g. long/lat) Understand the main types of spatial data format in R Be able to convert your data to either sp or sf format Load regional and country borders using rnaturalearth Plot sp data using the base package and interactively using Leaflet Critically analyse rain-gauge locations in R. Add a theme, authorship and table of contents to your markdown files. 2.2 Lab set-up 2.2.1 Create a Lab 2 Project R Projects are useful because you can easily keep your labs and future projects separate, without losing your code and data. For example,if you want to go back to an old Lab (say Lab 1), you can simply go into the Lab folder and click Lab1.RProj - this will open R and all your old code so you can carry on where you left off. So, to keep things tidy on your computer, lets create a new R-Project. Make a new project called Lab 2 inside your GEOG364 folder. Hint: Go to the main menu-bar at the very top of the screen, then click: File | New Project | New Directory | New Project. Then call the project Lab 2 and make sure it’s created as a sub-directory of your GEOG-364 folder. Or follow the instructions in Section 1.3.3. Now, go to the File menu/New File/R Notebook to create a new blank lab script. Delete the “friendly text” - see section 1.8 and save it as GEOG364_Lab2_PSU.ID.Rmd e.g. GEOG364_Lab2_hlg5155.Rmd You should see something like the figure below, If you type getwd() into the console, it should return the location of the Lab 2 folder on your computer. Figure 2.1: What your screen should look like, but the address of getwd() should be the one on your computer. Note that pressing save on the script has automatically made your .nb.html file 2.2.2 Markdown adding a theme While your lab script is blank, lets focus on the YAML code at the top (lines 1-4). This makes your html output and there are loads of ways we can customise it. Importantly YAML code always starts and ends with — Secondly, it is VERY case and space sensitive. If something looks like it should work but it’s not, check that you have exactly the right number of spaces before the text on each line (tabs might break it) Your YAML code currently looks like this --- title: &quot;R Notebook&quot; output: html_notebook --- Change the YAML code to look like this (but with your name). Note, if you copy/paste this and it doesn’t work, sometimes the quote marks copy weirdly from the internet - try deleting and retyping the quotes. --- title: &quot;Geog-364: Lab 2&quot; author: &quot;Helen Greatrex&quot; date: &quot;`r Sys.Date()`&quot; output: html_notebook: toc: true toc_float: yes number_sections: true theme:lumen --- IMPORTANT, if you are typing this, the spaces at the start of some lines are important and are created using the TAB KEY. There is one TAB key before html_notebook (which is now on a new line). There are two TAB KEYS before toc, toc_float, number_sections and theme OK so here we now have: The title The author Today’s date And output with a floating table of contents and numbered sections (this won’t appear until you start typing section headings) and the entire thing is in the lumen theme Save your file, or click “preview” at the top of the script. See if it works. If you click the knit button to make a html rather than a nb.html, then you will need to add a few extra lines for both output formats. So yours should look something like this. Figure 2.2: Where the point &amp; click package install button is Don’t continue until you can make and view your html or nb.html file. If it doesn’t work, ask for help before moving on Challenge You can view themes for markdown documents here. https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/ Choose one that works for you and edit your YAML code to load it. 2.2.3 Installing common spatial packages Because R is open-source and anyone can create custom collections of commands, there are an ever increasing number of packages in R. We are going to install some of the most common spatial analysis tools. Specifically, we are going to install rgdal, raster, sp, sf,leaflet,tmap and rnaturalearth. This can take some time, so I suggest getting the download running, then returning here to continue reading through the lab notes. As discussed in the previous lab, you can do this EITHER by [1] Copy/Pasting this command into the CONSOLE (if you put it in a code chunk, it will download and install every single time you run your script, which we don’t need): install.packages(c(&quot;rgdal&quot;, &quot;raster&quot;, &quot;sp&quot;,&quot;sf&quot;,&quot;rnaturalearth&quot; &quot;leaflet&quot;,&quot;tmap&quot;)) OR by [2] Going to the Packages menu (next to plots), clicking install, then choosing each package one by one (make sure install dependencies is clicked). Figure 2.3: Where the point &amp; click package install button is Once the packages have finished downloading and you can see the &gt; symbol again in the console, you can move on. In your script, make a new R-code chunk, Copy this code inside and run it. library(rgdal) library(sf) library(raster) library(knitr) library(sp) library(raster) library(leaflet) library(tmap) library(rnaturalearth) You should see similar messages to ones that come up here. Figure 2.4: Common friendly messages If instead of this, you see loads of red error code: Re-run the code chunk. Sometimes that clears it up Check you have spelt everything correctly Try to re-install the package, then re-run the code chunk If you are still seeing errors, ask for help. 2.2.4 Download data for this lab Now you need to download some data from Dr Greatrex’s github repository: A table of weather station locations in Ghana. Copy/Paste this code either into the console to download the files. ## Note, the structure of an R command. We have a function (a command), download.file(). ## R knows it is a function because it has parentheses after it. ## Inside the parentheses are the arguments that R needs to carry out the command ## (e.g. the address and the filename), separated by commas filelocation &lt;- &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hgreatrex/GEOG364_Labs/master/Lab_2/Lab02_GhanaMetStations.csv&quot; download.file(filelocation, destfile = &quot;Lab02_GhanaMetStations.csv&quot; , verbose=TRUE) The file should appear in your Lab 2 folder. If not, you probably didn’t create the project above, or your getwd() didn’t show your Lab 2 folder. 2.3 Data.frames and summary statistics 2.3.1 Reading in your first file In your script, make a new Section heading called “Data Input”. If you can’t remember how to do this, see Section 1.7.3, or pull up the Markdown Quick Reference Guide (see the Figure below) Figure 2.5: The incredibly useful Markdown quick reference The data you just downloaded, Lab02_GhanaMetStations.csv is essentially a basic spreadsheet called a .csv file (each number is separated by a comma). You can open this in Excel or notepad to have a look, but DO NOT SAVE. Let’s start by reading this file into R. To do this, create a new code chunk and copy this code into it, including comments # The read.csv command reads in a csv table of data into R. # We then save the table as a variable called Stations. Stations &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./Lab02_GhanaMetStations.csv&quot;,as.is=TRUE) You should see that “Stations” has turned up in your environment area on your screen, probably on the top right. If you click on its name, you can have a look at the table, which can be a useful cross check to make sure that it all read into R successfully. Or, if you prefer you can print it into the console or into a code chunk, by typing its name into the console. In R, this type of data (a table) is called a data.frame. Figure 2.6: First look at the Stations data 2.3.2 Summarising data There are several functions that you can use to summarise data, especially data in a table. These include: str(TABLENAME) summary(TABLENAME) Where TABLENAME is the name of the data.frame variable you wish to explore. Challenge Create a code chunk and apply the functions above to Stations. Then in the text below the code chunk, use the results of your code to answer these questions: How many rows of data does the table have? What is the average Longitude of the stations? 2.3.3 Selecting columns and rows Sometimes, we do not want to analyse at the entire data.frame. Instead, we would like to only look at one (or more) columns or rows. There are several ways we can select data. The first is we can use the $ symbol to select its name. For example, to select the Latitude column, you can use the command # COLUMN NAMES ARE CASE SENSITIVE Stations$Latitude Secondly, we can use square brackets to numerically choose a column. This follows the format: TABLENAME[ROWS,COLUMNS] # This will select the 5th row and 7th column Stations[5,7] # This will select the 2nd row and ALL the columns Stations[2,] # This will select the 3rd column and ALL the rows Stations[,3] # We can combine our commands, this will print the 13th row of the Longitude column # (no comma as we&#39;re only looking at one column) Stations$Longitude[13] # The : symbol lets you choose a sequence of numbers e.g. 1:5 is 1 2 3 4 5 # So this prints out rows 11 to 15 Stations[11:15,] # The &quot;c&quot; command allows you to enter whatever numbers you like. # So this will print out rows 4,3,7 and all the columns Stations[c(4,3,7),] Challenge In a new code chunk, write and run the code to: Select Rows:4,6,2 and Columns:1 and 2 , then assign it to a variable called subset. Print values/rows 45:50 of the Station.Name column (you will just see 5 names as the answer) Apply the median() function to the Latitude column and print the output. E.g. what is the MEDIAN latitude in the Stations dataset? There is one Station.Name that has been duplicated (a common issue). Apply the table() function to the appropriate column to work out which station it is. Write the name of the station as a COMMENT inside the code chunk below your line of code. 2.3.4 Basic plot We can now make a basic plot of our data. Here we can use the plot command along with our new found knowledge to select columns. plot(Stations$Longitude,Stations$Latitude) This gives us the basics but it could be made more “pretty”. If you type ?par into the console, or search for par in help, you will see a load of arguments that can improve the plot. For example, adding in the asp (aspect ratio) and pch (point shape) arguments will give plot(Stations$Longitude,Stations$Latitude, pch=16, col=&quot;blue&quot;) Challenge Make a new code chunk and make a plot of the station locations. Your plot should include: - Red points - An aspect ratio of 1 (asp argument) - Better x and y labels (xlab and ylab arguments) - A point size of 0.5 (cex arguments) Although this plot is OK, we can definitely improve using the specific spatial data that R uses. 2.4 Converting to spatial data R is not clever. It’s a bit like working with a toddler. We might know that the words Longitude and Latitude have special spatial meaning for our Stations table, but R is not intelligent enough to work this out. So there are special spatial packages to help R understand spatial data. Specifically, there are four “mainstream” packages dedicated to dealing with both vector and raster spatial data: sp sf raster terra (not covered in this course but likely the future) Many package authors will write their commands assuming that your data is in a specific spatial format. So understanding how to read in data into different formats is a useful skill. There are also some very specific packages which are slightly different. We will touch upon later in the semester, such as the ppp package for point pattern analysis, or ncdf4 for netcdf analysis. 2.4.1 Making a data.frame “spatial” To convert a data.frame to a sf object, we use the st_as_sf command: #-------------------------------------------------------------------------- # To convert to sf format # Here, &quot;Longitude&quot; and &quot;Latitude&quot; should be the # EXACT CASE-SENSITIVE COLUMN NAMES of your x and y columns in your table. # There is nothing special about the words longitude and latitude here #-------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stations_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(Stations, coords = c(&quot;Longitude&quot;, &quot;Latitude&quot;)) Stations_sf ## Simple feature collection with 598 features and 1 field ## geometry type: POINT ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: -3.033 ymin: 4.783 xmax: 1.65 ymax: 11.0833 ## CRS: NA ## First 10 features: ## Station.Name geometry ## 1 23007DI POINT (-1.95 4.783) ## 2 23007DIX POINT (-1.95 4.7833) ## 3 23005PRI POINT (-2.133 4.8) ## 4 23002SES POINT (-1.917 4.85) ## 5 23001AXM POINT (-2.2333 4.8667) ## 6 23001AM POINT (-2.233 4.867) ## 7 23004AGO POINT (-1.967 4.883) ## 8 23005TAK POINT (-1.766 4.89) ## 9 23003TDI POINT (-1.774 4.894) ## 10 18025ABR POINT (-2.05 4.9) To convert a data.frame to a sp object, we simply tell it what the coordinates are: #-------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Or convert the original table to sp format #-------------------------------------------------------------------------- coordinates(Stations) &lt;- c(&quot;Longitude&quot;,&quot;Latitude&quot;) # Print out the result. You can see that R now sees it as a &quot;Spatial Points Data.frame&quot; Stations ## class : SpatialPointsDataFrame ## features : 598 ## extent : -3.033, 1.65, 4.783, 11.0833 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## crs : NA ## variables : 1 ## names : Station.Name ## min values : 01000BAB ## max values : 23098ACC Let’s talk about the new information R is giving us here. We have class: You can have a spatial points dataframe, a spatial lines dataframe, or a spatial polygons dataframe. So you can see what type of vector data you have features: How many points are there (equivalent to the number of rows) extent: What is the furthest North/South/East/West that the data extends crs: The map projection. See the next section variables How many attributes of the data do we have? We just have one, Station.Name names: The names of your attributes (the other things you can plot) min values and max values Some information about the attributes, in our case the first and last station. Challenge Make a new heading called “Spatial Analysis” Underneath that, create a new code chunk and use the code above to convert your Stations data to sp format. In the console, type plot(Stations). Your plot should now look very different. Above the code chunk, in the white text, explain what you just did. Figure 2.7: Plotting the data now it is sp format 2.4.2 Reading in vector line data (rnaturalearth) So we now have something that looks “spatial”, but let’s now also include some vector, line data on top. Specifically, lets include some country boundaries. There are many types of spatial vector data available, with the most common being shapefiles. In later labs, we will learn how to read in vector data from a file, but this time we are going to use data that is already build into R. This is part of the rnaturalearth package. This is a package which links automatically with the “Natural Earth” dataset, found here: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/features/ For administrative border data, we can use the ne_countries command: https://rdrr.io/cran/rnaturalearth/man/ne_countries.html For example, this would load the entire world borders and assign it to a variable called worldborder. # You can choose if you want the output to be sf or sp data worldborder &lt;- ne_countries(scale = &quot;medium&quot;, returnclass = &quot;sp&quot;) plot(worldborder) and this would load the regional boarders for the United Kingdom # You can choose if you want the output to be sf or sp data UK &lt;- ne_states(country=&quot;united kingdom&quot;,returnclass = &quot;sp&quot;) plot(UK) Challenge In your script, make a new section heading called “Vector data”. Now make a new code chunk and use the ne_countries command to load regional borders for Ghana. Assign it to a variable called ghana. Above the code chunk, in the white text, explain what you just did. 2.5 Assigning a map projection As discussed in Wednesday’s lecture, a map projection, or coordinate system is an essential part of spatial statistics. Also, say we want to overlay country boarders on our points. In that case, the coordinate systems of the shapefiles need to be identical. R makes use of the PROJ4 library which is a set of character strings that defines a coordinate system (a datum and/or map projection definition). The PROJ4 character string syntax consists of a list of parameters, each prefixed with the + character. For example, the familiar UTM grid system is defined by +proj=utm the specific zone number (e.g., 19) is defined by +zone=19 and the datum (e.g., NAD 1983) is defined by +datum=NAD83 Putting these parameters together, we would see something like this: \"+proj=utm +zone=19 +datum=NAD83 +no_defs +ellps=GRS80 +togrs80\" A list of a the PROJ4 map projection names and their parameters used in defining a coordinate system can be found here: https://proj.org/operations/projections/index.html. We will also discuss this in more detail in later labs. If you are really interested in projections, for a comprehensive guide, use this resource: https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/reproj-geo-data.html 2.5.1 Checking a projection in the sp package In most cases, dealing with spatial data will involve changing the datum definition, map projection, or one of the map projection parameters (such as the central meridian or standard parallels). **You can check the existing projection using the projection command ## Here SPATIALDATA is the name of the object you want to examine projection(SPATIALDATA) Challenge In a new code chunk, print out the projection of Stations and also the projection of ghana. You should see that one is “NA” and one is a common long-lat projection: \"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0\". Above the code chunk, in the white text, explain what you just did. This can causes problems! If our map projections are different for different datasets, then they will not align with each other in any plots or analysis. So lets change the projection of Stations. 2.5.2 Assign/changing projections in the sp package To change a projection: IF THE PROJECTION IS NA: To set the first ever coordinate system for an sp object, you would use the the CRS command # Nothing should happen when you run the code chunk if there&#39;s no error # Here SPATIALDATA is the name of the object you want to assign a projection to # proj4string(SPATIALDATA) &lt;- CRS(&quot;your projection code&quot;) #e.g. to change the projection of Stations to UTM, the code would be as follows proj4string(Stations) &lt;- CRS(&quot;+proj=utm +zone=19 +datum=NAD83 +no_defs +ellps=GRS80 +togrs80&quot;) # THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOUR DATA ALREADY HAS A PROJECTION If your data ALREADY HAS a projection: you can change it using the spTransform command # Nothing should happen when you run the code chunk if there&#39;s no error # Here SPATIALDATA is the name of the object you want to assign a projection to proj4string(Stations) &lt;- CRS(&quot;+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84&quot;) Challenge In a new code chunk, assign the projection of your Stations data to be long-lat, data to match your ghana map: \"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84\" 2.5.3 Map projections in the sf package The same kind of transformations can also take place in sf formats. Unlike with RGDAL, you would use sf_transform() for sf formatted data. 2.6 Interactive Leaflet plots Let’s now see how our data looks plotted. Create a new sub-heading called “Data Plots” Now, in a new code chunk enter the following code. plot(Stations) plot(ghana,add=TRUE) You should see a basic plot that looks like this. If so, congrats! If not, you need to adjust your projections or something has happened. The plot above is still pretty basic, so lets explore some of the big packages available to let you make “pretty plots” of spatial data. There are three big mapping functions in R: ggmap, tmap and leaflet. Today, we are going to make some interactive maps using leaflet. Leaflet is an interactive mapping tool that goes far beyond R. Watch the video to get a sense of it. To make our first Leaflet plot, we will ignore the %&gt;% symbol you saw in the video. Essentially we make a leaflet map by adding layers. At the end, we print the map by typing its name. In this case we have: LAYER 1: Load the Stations data into leaflet and assign it to a variable called mymap LAYER 2: Use addProviderTiles to add a custom map background onto mymap. You can find different examples here: http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html LAYER 3: Add custom markers to mymap, each one labeled with the Station.Name (taken from the Station.Name column of the data.frame) LAYER 4: Add the country borders from the ghana data. These are actually polygons, so make sure the fillOpacity is 0 to only show the border. LAYER 4: Print the final map # leaflet makes maps in layers and only at the end, prints out the final map #LAYER1 mymap &lt;- leaflet(data = Stations) #LAYER2 mymap &lt;- addProviderTiles(mymap, providers$Stamen.Toner) #LAYER3 mymap &lt;- addCircleMarkers(mymap, label = ~as.character(Station.Name), radius=.3,opacity = 0.8) # R doesn&#39;t care if one command is on 2 lines.. #LAYER4 mymap &lt;- addPolygons(mymap, data=ghana,weight=2,col = &#39;red&#39;,fillOpacity = 0) #LAYER5 mymap Challenge Copy the code above into your own code chunk. Then change the map background to a more informative one (your choice). 2.7 Describe the Ghana data Finally, some science! Even though we are going to learn some advanced techniques in this course, one of the most important ways to analyse spatial data is to look at it and explore its features. We often want to map rainfall across the world. Because rainfall is a field (there is a value everywhere), it would initially make sense to spread your rain-gauges out in a uniform grid. Yet, in Ghana at least, this is not what is happening. Examine the Ghana rain-gauge data in your leaflet plot. Try different map backgrounds (terrain, land-use, others..). Try to understand why the data is spatially distributed the way it is Now write a paragraph (or bullet points, remember your RMarkdown Quick Reference for how), that where you explain: What type of data are we looking at? What map projection does it have? You describe the spatial structure of the data and any key features that it has You describe why you think the data looks this way spatially. Provide evidence for your answers (you can have multiple plots if you want) What features in the data would concern you if you were a data scientist? Can you see any likely errors? 2.8 “Show us something new” Finally, this section is going to be a feature of all of your labs in GEOG-364 and likely in GEOG-464. One of the reasons an “A” is set at 90% is so that you can skip this section and still get an A. It is designed to challenge you and to push your R-coding skills. In GEOG-364 I will try to give some suggestions, so you get used to the concept. Create a new section header called “Show me something new”. Beneath this, you need to show some new code or some new aspect of Markdown that goes beyond the lab. It doesn’t have to be long. You should also explain in your text or comments what the code does and what you are hoping to achieve. If you are struggling, you can show me some minor additions to existing code for 5/10 marks. For example: Copying code from earlier in the lab to plot some data, or the station data, then changing the point type (pch) to crosses, or making the colors transparent Adding a new YAML element (you will have to do this at the top and describe what you did here) Showing me you know how to do some new markdown format (tables, links), https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-6.html Something you think of - be creative! For full marks you need to demonstrates the use of a function or concept that was not specifically covered in the handout, lecture, or lab. For example: Plotting the station data / borders using something like ggplot or tmap Loading the RColorBrewer data and using that for your plots Loading a rnaturalearth raster file and plotting that (bonus mark if it is over Ghana and you can plot your points on top) Do something with a new package like library(emojifont) Or your idea (welcomed) You will lose 2 marks for not explaining in the text what you are trying to achieve and what the commands are that do so. It should be clear you understand your code. 2.9 Lab submission check MARKDOWN/CODE STYLE - 5 MARKS Your code and document is neat and easy to read. You have section headings, have clearly labeled your answers or described what you are trying to do in the code. YAML - 10 marks You have adjusted your YAML code to include a theme, author, data and table of contents. This should show up in your final nb.html or html file R-BASICS - 30 marks You correctly answered all the questions in Section 2.6.2, 2.6.3 and 2.6.4. SPATIAL BASICS - 20 marks You checked the projections of Stations and ghana and adjusted the map projection of the Station data to be long/lat Section 2.10. You also plotted the ghana and Station data using the standard plot function and Leaflet (where you changed the theme) GHANA DESCRIPTION - 20 marks You included a thoughtful, well organized, and articulated response to the question about the Ghana gauges SOMETHING NEW - 5 marks You made a minor change to an existing piece of code (2.5/5) OR You demonstrated the use of a function or concept that was not specifically covered in the handout, lecture, or lab (5/5) HTML FILE SUBMISSION - 5 marks RMD CODE SUBMISSION - 5 marks [100 marks total] THERE IS NO CANVAS QUIZ WITH THIS LAB "]
